<p> wall shelves are a stylish, practical way
to maximize storage in any space. Here's
what you'll need to properly secure one
to the wall.
First, determine the shelf's location. You
want your new shelf to be sturdy and
level so proper placement is key. If the
shelf is heavy, or you plan on storing
bulky items it's best to install the
hardware directly to wall studs. If a
stud is unavailable, you'll need to
install appropriate wall anchors for the
job. Next,  pull the shelf in place and
make a light line along the underside.
then using the line as a reference,
position each bracket and mark the
location of the hanging hardware.

Now using a drill on low speed. or a
screwdriver make starter holes into your
marks without fully installing the
screws to secure the brackets. You'll
need to back out each screw and set it
aside.
Install a drywall anchor if necessary
before attaching the bracket. Now place
the bracket in position and fasten it to
the wall.
[Music]
Finally, Center the shelf atop the
brackets. Then for added security, fasten
the shelf to the brackets

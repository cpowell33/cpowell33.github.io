<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>My name is Cody Powell, I was born and raised in Baker City, Oregon. I was raised without electricity for the first 13 years of my life. I was unable to enjoy many of the technological wonders of my peers while I was growing up.
Once I gained access to some of these technologies for the first time, I became fascinated with what they could do and how they worked. While I was already skilled with my hands because of my upbringing, I found a strong desire to become
skilled with technology and computers. This is one of the reasons I became a student of computer programming at Southwestern.<p/>

<p>One of the other reasons that led me this program, was the realization that learning to code could be a useful and marketable skill in the future. I joined the Air Force as active duty in 2014. When I joined I wanted to do something
that I would enjoy while serving my country. After much deliberation and consideration of what was available, I was eventually placed into the Armament Systems Career Field. While this is an awesome career field with many opportunities
inside the military, there are not many applications in the civilian sector. I began considering what I would do with myself after retirement from the military. I concluded that with a strong maintenance background and a degree in computer
programming, I would hopefully have many opportunities once I completed my military service. These are the two main reasons that I decided to travel down this path.<p/>
